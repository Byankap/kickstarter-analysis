# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
		Analyzing different campaigns to identify patterns such as the relation between successful outcomes and launch dates or funding goals

### Purpose
		The purpose of this analysis was to answer the following two questions: "What were the outcomes based on launch date" and "What were the outcomes based on goals."

## Analysis and Challenges/Difficulties
		After cleaning the data, two charts needed to be created to present the data. A challenge that was encountered was creating the “Outcome Based on Goals” chart. By filtering the data based on theater category, when selecting the ‘number of successes” column, it was it was selecting the fields that were hidden. This was creating an error. It was solved by inspecting the syntax. The syntax had the valued out of range, I replace it with “G:G.” 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
		Based on the “Outcome Based on Launch Date” graph, successful outcomes occurred were more likely to occur in the summertime. This can help future campaigns to launch in the summer (May-Aug) instead in the winter. Failed data was static, data ranging from 31%-51%, but 30% of failed campaigns occurred in the winter (50% in the summer).
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
		The “Outcome Based on Goals” graph shows that as the goals that were less than $1000, were  successful compared to other goal ranges. As the goal ranged increased, the percentage of success decreased. Complain goals that range between $10-5000, are about 70% successful.  

 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	The two conclusions are that successful outcome likely occur in the summer, and less likely to be successful in the wintertime. In addition, failure was 50% likely to occur in the summertime. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	The smaller the goal, the higher the chance of success. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	When analyzing the data, the data analytic, needed to organize the data to create a launch date that was understandable to humans. Cleaning the data was needed to remove the blanks from  the dataset.What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

	Graphs can also be created based on the other categories, to find which categories has the highest goal success.
